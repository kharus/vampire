/** A smart pointer that lets you keep memory allocated, and reuse it.
 * Constructs an object of type T on the heap. When the Recycled<T> is destroyed,
 * the object is not returned, but the object is reset using Reset::operator(),
 * and returned to a pool of pre-allocated objects. When the next Recycled<T> is
 * constructed an object from the pool is returned instead of allocating heap memory.
 *
 * This may be useful if profiling suggests it, but in general you should not need this.
 * If you think you do, there are the following tradeoffs:
 * - more construction overhead than both automatic and (slightly) static storage
 * - extra indirection: Recycled<T> internally holds a pointer to T
 * - shares allocations of type T between all instances of Recycled<T>
 * - safer than static storage due to the Reset mechanism
 * - Recycled<T> is reentrant, whereas static is not
 * - "leaks" memory, retaining the peak number of concurrently-live T objects
 * - implements move semantics where T may not
 * - "destruction" often very cheap because T is never destroyed
 *
 * To summarise:
 * 1. Use automatic storage unless you really have to do something else.
 * 2. If you must, use Recycled<T> by preference to static for safety reasons.
 * 3. If you really must and you are sure of correctness (reentrancy, reset logic),
 *    use static storage.
